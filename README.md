# SnackIndex (DEMO, unfinished)

Demo for SnackIndex project intended to be built in React Native. This was the initial iteration where the whole application would have been created in a two person development team with [rpremi12](https://github.com/rpremi12/) but due to scheduling conflicts, shifted to a Figma project.

That said, I still keep this up because this was a lot of fun to make and I liked learning about React Native and getting my toes wet into developer environments like expo. To make it work, make sure you:

1. npm install all of your dependencies in the "test-login-page"
2. Have expo installed
3. expo start
